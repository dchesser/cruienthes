#+TITLE: Counties of Cruienthes Quarterly Zine
#+AUTHOR: Dave Chesser
#+STARTUP: nofold

* What?

Yet another zine (small "magazine") for table-top role-playing games.
Specifically a setting known as, as the title states, Cruienthes,
a low-ish fantasy realm inspired by +real life+ +a fever dream+
+a dada nightmare+ improvized worldbuilding and solitaire gaming.
While made with [[https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1637945166/worlds-without-number][Worlds Without Number]] and [[https://necroticgnome.com/collections/old-school-essentials][Old-School Essentials]] in mind,
it should be compatible with most d20-based games from before 1990.

I missed out on [[https://www.kickstarter.com/zine-quest][Zine Quest]] last February so this is my time
to get started and jot things down.

* Compiling

To build a zine, you need [[https://islandoftex.gitlab.io/arara/][Arara]], the build tool, and [[https://wiki.contextgarden.net/Main_Page][ConTeXt]],
the typesetting system.
Both should be available in a full [[https://tug.org/texlive/][TeX Live]] distribution.
