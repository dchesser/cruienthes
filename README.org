#+TITLE: Cruienthes County Quarterly Zine
#+AUTHOR: Dave Chesser
#+STARTUP: nofold

* What?

Yet another zine (small "magazine") for table-top role-playing games.
Specifically a setting known as, as the title states, the county
of Cruienthes.
I missed out on [[https://www.kickstarter.com/zine-quest][Zine Quest]] last February so this is my time
to get started and jot things down.

* Compiling

To build a zine, you need [[https://islandoftex.gitlab.io/arara/][Arara]], the build tool, and [[https://wiki.contextgarden.net/Main_Page][ConTheXt]],
the typesetting system.
Both should be available in a full [[https://tug.org/texlive/][TeX Live]] distribution.
